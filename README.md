## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learn How to design and how the workflow of the web project will work from designing to deploying and using a flex box and most imporatanly how to implement the differet js logic for the specific projects. 

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
put all the calculator button in array and apply click event on all of them using foreach loop.

Array.from(elements).forEach((array_name)>{
    array_name.AddEventlister('click',(e)=>{
        console.log(e.target);
    });
});
```

### Continued development

I will develop some of more project on venilla js and them move to the react and look why people are so crazy about it.
